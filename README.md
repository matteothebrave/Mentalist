### This "Game" has been created during Alura's ImersÃ£o Dev Class.

### It's a simple script using javascript to generate random numbers.

-> You have to input a number 0 - 10
-> Try your luck gessing which number the program randomized.
-> If your guess is right a green message will show, else, a red one will appear.

## GOOD LUCK!
